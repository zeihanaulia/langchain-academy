    "# Brainstorming Agent for Product Owner\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a sophisticated brainstorming agent designed for Product Owners (POs) using LangGraph's ReAct architecture. The agent integrates web browsing, memory management, dynamic PRD generation, and human-in-the-loop interactions to facilitate iterative product development discussions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "- **Architecture**: ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) with conditional routing and tool integration.\n",
    "- **Key Features**: Web research via Tavily API, persistent memory, AI-driven PRD creation, and collaborative refinement.\n",
    "- **Use Case**: POs brainstorming features (e.g., reporting for Power Cash), with the agent handling research, analysis, and documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This builds on concepts from previous modules (e.g., chains, routers, agents) by adding advanced state management and multi-tool orchestration."

    "## Section Explanation: Setup and Import\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it Works**: This section establishes the foundational environment by installing dependencies and importing necessary modules for LangGraph-based agent development. It ensures compatibility with external APIs like Tavily for enhanced web search capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it Does**:\n",
    "- **Package Installation**: Uses `pip` to install `langchain-openai` (for LLM integration), `langgraph` (for graph orchestration), `langgraph-prebuilt` (for built-in tools and conditions), and `tavily-python` (for web search).\n",
    "- **Module Imports**: Imports core LangChain components (e.g., `ChatOpenAI` for model interaction, `tool` decorator for function binding), LangGraph primitives (e.g., `StateGraph`, `MessagesState`), and utilities (e.g., `add_messages` reducer for state updates).\n",
    "- **API Configuration**: Defines a helper function `_set_env` to securely prompt for API keys (OpenAI for LLM, Tavily for search), preventing hardcoding and ensuring runtime flexibility.\n",
    "- **Model Initialization**: Instantiates `ChatOpenAI` with GPT-4o, providing a high-capability LLM backbone for reasoning and tool calling.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup mirrors best practices in LangGraph tutorials, ensuring reproducibility and security."

    "## Section Explanation: Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it Works**: Defines a suite of Python functions decorated with `@tool`, enabling the LLM to invoke external capabilities dynamically. Each tool is bound to the model via `bind_tools`, allowing the agent to reason about when and how to use them based on user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it Does**:\n",
    "- **`browse_web`**: Leverages Tavily API for semantic web search. It queries the web, retrieves top results (up to 3), and formats them as title-content pairs. This enhances research accuracy compared to basic APIs, supporting real-time information gathering for brainstorming.\n",
    "- **`save_to_memory`**: Appends user-provided information to a global `memory` list. This implements persistent state across graph invocations, allowing the agent to reference prior context (e.g., previous research findings) in subsequent interactions.\n",
    "- **`read_file`**: Reads the contents of any file and returns it to the user. Useful for examining existing documents, code files, or configuration files during brainstorming sessions.\n",
    "- **`edit_file`**: Performs precise text replacements in existing files. Takes an old string and new string, finds the exact match, and replaces it. Essential for making targeted edits to documents or code.\n",
    "- **`apply_patch`**: Applies patches or diffs to files. Supports unified diff format with +/- indicators for additions and deletions. Useful for applying code changes or document updates from external sources.\n",
    "- **`generate_prd`**: Uses the LLM to dynamically generate or update a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) in Markdown. Only activates when user explicitly requests PRD generation or editing. If updating existing PRD, it reads the current file and incorporates new information while preserving existing content. The generated/updated PRD is automatically saved to a markdown file in the `prds/` directory for easy access, sharing, or further processing (e.g., conversion to DOCX or import to Confluence). This tool exemplifies AI-driven documentation with intelligent update capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools are registered in a list and bound to the LLM, enabling conditional execution via LangGraph's `tools_condition`. This approach aligns with LangChain's tool-calling paradigm, promoting modularity and extensibility."

    "  - **`assistant`**: Core reasoning node. Invokes the LLM with system prompt and state messages, returning responses that may include tool calls. It preserves memory for continuity.\n",
    "  - **`tools`**: Executes tool calls via `ToolNode`, which automatically routes to the appropriate function (e.g., `browse_web`). Results are appended to messages.\n",

    "- **Graph Construction**:\n",
    "  - **Nodes**: Added via `add_node` for modularity.\n",

    "\n",
    "**What it Does**:\n",
    "- **Execution Example**: Invokes the graph with a PO's initial query (e.g., \"Add reporting feature to Power Cash\"). The agent browses, analyzes, generates PRD, and handles human feedback in a loop. Outputs include message history and memory for traceability.\n",
    "- **LangGraph Studio Integration**: Provides setup for local development server. Running `langgraph dev` in the `/studio` directory launches a web UI at `http://127.0.0.1:2024`, allowing visual graph inspection, step-by-step execution, and real-time testing. This is essential for refining agent behavior, as per LangGraph's official guides.\n",

    "## How to Use\n",
    "1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure API keys for OpenAI and Tavily are configured in your environment or `.env` file.\n",
    "2. **Run Setup Cells**: Execute the installation and import cells to prepare dependencies.\n",
    "3. **Invoke the Graph**: Run the example cell for a single execution, or use the interactive session cell for full human-in-the-loop experience.\n",
    "4. **Interactive Session**: Uncomment and run `run_interactive_session()` in the interactive cell. The agent will respond, and you'll be prompted for feedback after each AI response.\n",
    "5. **Brainstorming**: Have natural conversations about features, ideas, and requirements. The agent will only use tools when explicitly requested.\n",
    "6. **PRD Generation**: Type \"generate PRD\" or \"edit PRD\" when you want to create or update the PRD document. The agent will intelligently update existing files rather than creating duplicates.\n",
    "7. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Provide feedback or additional input when prompted. Type 'exit' to end the session.\n",
    "8. **Iterate Until Satisfaction**: Continue the loop until the PO approves the output.\n",
    "9. **Debug with Studio**: Use LangGraph Studio for visual tracing and adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PRD Behavior**:\n",
    "- Only generates/updates when explicitly requested\n",
    "- Updates existing PRD files instead of creating duplicates\n",
    "- Preserves existing content while incorporating new information\n",
    "- Uses professional Everest Back Office user story templates\n",
    "\n",
    "**File Manipulation Tools**:\n",
    "- Use \"read file [path]\" to examine existing documents\n",
    "- Use \"edit file [path] replace [old_text] with [new_text]\" for precise edits\n",
    "- Use \"apply patch [path] [patch_content]\" to apply diffs or patches\n",
    "- All tools work with absolute or relative file paths"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has demonstrated the creation of a sophisticated brainstorming agent for Product Owners using LangGraph's ReAct architecture. Key takeaways include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ReAct Integration**: Combining reasoning (LLM) with acting (tools) for dynamic, iterative workflows.\n",
    "- **State Management**: Using custom state classes and reducers to maintain context across interactions.\n",
    "- **Tool Orchestration**: Binding multiple tools to the LLM for seamless external integrations (e.g., web search, memory, PRD generation).\n",
    "- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Enabling collaborative refinement through conditional routing and user feedback.\n",
    "- **Studio Deployment**: Leveraging LangGraph Studio for visualization, debugging, and production-ready deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "By building on foundational concepts from earlier modules (chains, routers, agents), this example showcases advanced LangGraph capabilities for real-world AI applications. Experiment with customizations to adapt the agent to your specific use cases, and explore LangGraph's ecosystem for further enhancements.\n",
    "\n",
